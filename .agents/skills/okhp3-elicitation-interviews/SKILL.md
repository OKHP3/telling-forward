description: Plan and facilitate structured elicitation sessions using BABOK v3 interview and workshop techniques. Use this skill when you need to gather process knowledge from subject matter experts; when the user wants a question plan before an interview or workshop; when elicitation is incomplete and gaps need targeted follow-up; when they say "help me interview the process owner", "prepare questions for the workshop", or "what should I ask to fill in the missing steps". Produces a question plan and elicitation notes template.

## Purpose

Generate a structured elicitation question plan and facilitate evidence-based process interviews using BABOK v3 §10.25 and §10.50 techniques. The plan targets known gaps in the PIR and provides sequenced, open-ended questions mapped to each PIR section.

---

## When to use this skill

- PIR exists but has `completeness_score < 70` or open_questions that need targeted follow-up
- User needs to interview a subject matter expert and wants a prepared question set
- User is planning a process discovery workshop and needs a facilitator guide
- You need to fill elicitation gaps before proceeding to `process-narrative-authoring`

## When NOT to use this skill

- PIR is already complete (score ≥ 70, no open_questions) — proceed directly to `process-narrative-authoring`
- User has no access to process owners — document the gap and proceed with assumptions flagged
- Do not fabricate answers from the question plan — only record what participants confirm

---

## Question Plan Generation

`scripts/generate-question-plan.mjs` reads the PIR and generates targeted questions for each incomplete section.

### Question categories

| PIR section | Question type | Sample opening |
|---|---|---|
| `trigger` | Context | "What makes you realise the process needs to start today?" |
| `actors` | Role | "Who else touches this beyond the people we've named?" |
| `inputs` | Artefact | "What document or data do you need before you can begin?" |
| `outputs` | Artefact | "What does the person receiving your output actually do with it?" |
| `steps` | Sequence | "Walk me through what you do on a typical day this runs." |
| `business_rules` | Constraint | "Is there a policy or procedure that forces you to do it this way?" |
| `exceptions` | Edge case | "Tell me about the last time this went wrong. What happened?" |
| `systems` | Tool | "Which systems do you open, update, or check during this process?" |
| `controls` | Governance | "How do you know when the process has been done correctly?" |

### Branching logic

- If `trigger.event_type` is absent → lead with Stage 1 trigger questions
- If `actors` has no `approver` → probe approval chain: *"Who has the authority to stop or reject this?"*
- If `exceptions` is empty → probe with historical incident: *"What was the hardest version of this you've dealt with?"*
- If `business_rules` is empty → probe obligation: *"Are there any rules you must follow that an outsider wouldn't know?"*

## Facilitation Guidelines

1. **Open with context** — read back the process name and one-sentence scope; confirm it is correct
2. **Use the question plan in order** — complete highest-gap sections first
3. **Probe with "tell me more"** — do not accept one-word answers for steps or rules
4. **Record verbatim** — capture exact wording of rules and exceptions; paraphrase only for clarity
5. **Flag uncertainty** — mark any answer prefaced with "I think" or "usually" as `confidence: low`
6. **Close with open invitation** — *"Is there anything else you think I should know to document this correctly?"*
7. **Write up within 24 hours** — update the PIR before memory fades

---

## Elicitation Notes Template

The `elicitation-notes.md` output contains:
- Session metadata (date, participants, facilitator, method)
- Answers mapped to PIR sections
- Verbatim quotes for business rules
- Confidence flags for uncertain answers
- Outstanding items that need follow-up

---

## Handoff Instruction

After elicitation, update `pir.yaml` and re-run `process-intake-and-scope` scoring. When score ≥ 70, pass `pir.yaml` to `stakeholder-and-role-mapping` and then `process-narrative-authoring`.
