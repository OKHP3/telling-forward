description: Conduct structured process intake and scope definition using BABOK v3 elicitation techniques. Use this skill when the user wants to document a business process from scratch; when they describe a workflow, procedure, or set of steps and need it structured; when they ask to scope a process, define process boundaries, or capture business rules; when they say "help me document this process", "let's scope out this workflow", or "what are the inputs and outputs"; when you need a Process Intake Record (PIR) as input for downstream narrative, modeling, or SOP skills.

# okhp3-process-intake-and-scope

**OverKill Hill P³** · [overkillhill.com](https://overkillhill.com) · [github.com/OKHP3](https://github.com/OKHP3)

## Purpose

This skill guides structured process intake and scope definition using BABOK v3-aligned elicitation techniques. It produces:

1. **Process Intake Record (PIR)** — structured YAML with trigger, actors, inputs, outputs, steps, exceptions, business rules, systems, and controls
2. **Scope Statement** — concise prose defining process boundaries, exclusions, and success criteria

The PIR is the foundational input consumed by every downstream skill in the BP-SKILL suite.

---

## When to use this skill

- User wants to document a process they describe in natural language, bullet points, or prose
- User says "help me scope this," "let's map this process," or "define the boundaries"
- You need a structured PIR before calling `stakeholder-and-role-mapping` or `process-narrative-authoring`
- User wants to capture business rules, exception paths, or system touchpoints for a workflow

## When NOT to use this skill

- A validated PIR with `ready_for_narrative: true` already exists — proceed to `process-narrative-authoring`
- User wants a diagram without prior discovery — use `visual-process-modeling` with their description
- Do not invent process details the user has not provided — record gaps as `open_questions`

---

## Intake Workflow

Execute the following stages in order. Conduct a natural conversation — do not present these as a checklist. Load `references/pir-schema.md` for full field reference.

### Stage 0 — Orientation

Ask: *"Before we start, can you give me one sentence: what does this process produce or accomplish?"*

Record as `process_name`. If vague, probe: *"Who benefits when this process runs correctly? What do they get?"*

### Stage 1 — Trigger

Ask: *"What causes this process to start — a person doing something, a scheduled date, an incoming message, or a system event?"*

Classify `trigger.event_type`:
- Person acts → `manual`
- Date/frequency → `scheduled`
- Message/request/email → `message`
- System condition → `system`

### Stage 2 — Actors

Ask: *"Who is involved — who does work, makes decisions, or needs to know the outcome?"*

Classify each actor: `initiator | performer | approver | reviewer | notified | system`.

**Minimum:** at least one `initiator` and one `performer` or `approver`.

### Stage 3 — Inputs and Outputs

Ask: *"What does this process need to begin?"* and *"What does it produce when complete?"*

Capture `name`, `source`/`consumer`, and `format` for each.

### Stage 4 — Scope Boundaries

Ask: *"What is explicitly outside the scope of this process? Where does it hand off?"*

Record out-of-scope items in `scope_statement.exclusions`.

### Stage 5 — Steps (Happy Path)

Ask: *"Walk me through what happens, step by step."*

After the happy path, probe for: notification steps, logging steps, waiting/pause steps.

### Stage 6 — Business Rules and Decision Points

For each decision: *"Who makes this? What are the outcomes? Is there a policy or rule that governs it?"*

Classify rule `source`: `policy | regulation | contract | practice`.

### Stage 7 — Exception Paths

Ask: *"What can go wrong? What happens when it does?"*

### Stage 8 — Systems and Controls

Ask: *"Which systems or tools are used?"* and *"Are there any checkpoints, approvals, or audits built in?"*

### Stage 9 — Open Questions

Record all unresolved gaps as `open_questions` — do not assume answers.

## PIR Completeness Scoring

`scripts/score-intake-completeness.mjs` returns a 0–100 weighted score.

| Section | Points |
|---|---|
| `process_name` | 5 |
| `elicitation_method` | 5 |
| `trigger` (both fields) | 10 |
| `actors` (≥2, initiator + performer/approver) | 15 |
| `inputs` (≥1 valid entry) | 10 |
| `outputs` (≥1 valid entry) | 10 |
| `steps` (≥3 valid entries) | 15 |
| `exceptions` (≥1 valid entry) | 10 |
| `business_rules` (≥1 valid entry) | 10 |
| `systems` (≥1 valid entry) | 5 |
| `controls` (≥1 valid entry) | 5 |
| **Total** | **100** |

**Handoff threshold:** score ≥ 70 → `ready_for_narrative: true`

---

## Output Format

1. Produce `pir.yaml` using `assets/fixtures/intake-purchase-approval.yaml` as the schema reference
2. Run `scripts/score-intake-completeness.mjs` to compute `completeness_score` and `ready_for_narrative`
3. Produce `scope-statement.md` summarising process name, trigger, boundary, exclusions, and success criteria

---

## Handoff Instruction

When `ready_for_narrative: true`:
- Pass `pir.yaml` to `stakeholder-and-role-mapping` to derive the stakeholder register
- Then pass `pir.yaml` + `stakeholder-register.yaml` to `process-narrative-authoring`

When `ready_for_narrative: false`, report missing sections and ask targeted follow-up questions.
