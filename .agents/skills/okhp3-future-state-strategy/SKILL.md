name: okhp3-future-state-strategy
description: Design a target-state process and a structured change strategy from a gap analysis. Use this skill when the user wants to redesign a process after gaps have been identified; when they ask "what should the process look like", "how do we fix this", "design the to-be process", or "build a change plan". Produces a future-state process artifact and a change strategy document. This is a recommended extension skill — use after process-gap-and-exception-analysis has produced a gap analysis. Scope firewall applies: never include employer-proprietary constraints without explicit user authorisation.

# okhp3-future-state-strategy

**OverKill Hill P³** · [overkillhill.com](https://overkillhill.com) · [github.com/OKHP3](https://github.com/OKHP3)

## Purpose

Design the target-state (to-be) process and a structured change strategy based on gap analysis findings. The future-state artifact documents the intended process design; the change strategy documents how to get there.

---

## When to use this skill

- `gap-analysis.yaml` exists with at least one `critical` or `major` gap
- User wants to redesign a process based on identified gaps
- User needs a change management plan to accompany process redesign
- Preparing the target-state PNS input for `process-narrative-authoring`

## When NOT to use this skill

- No gap analysis exists — run `process-gap-and-exception-analysis` first
- User wants to document only the current state — use `as-is-process-capture`
- Scope firewall: do not include confidential employer constraints, proprietary system names, or commercially sensitive process details without explicit user instruction

---

## Scope Firewall

This skill operates on process abstractions. Before authoring the future state:
- Confirm all described gaps are based on user-provided information
- Do not infer proprietary business rules from industry knowledge without flagging them as assumptions
- Flag all assumed constraints with `confidence: assumed` in the future-state YAML
- Do not include employer-identifying details in any generated artifact

---

## Future-State Design Workflow

### Step 1 — Prioritise gaps

Rank gaps from `gap-analysis.yaml` by severity: `critical → major → minor → observation`.

Focus the future-state design on resolving all critical and major gaps.

### Step 2 — Design to-be steps

For each resolved gap, define the replacement or new step:
- State the intended action in a single imperative statement
- Assign a named role (not a person)
- Define entry and exit criteria
- Specify any system or tool involved

### Step 3 — Validate completeness

Check the future-state design covers:
- All structural gaps (missing steps, unowned activities)
- All exception gaps (undefined handling, missing escalation)
- All compliance gaps (absent controls, missing segregation)

### Step 4 — Define change approach

For each major change, define:
- `change_type` — add | remove | modify | automate | transfer
- `effort` — low | medium | high
- `risk` — low | medium | high
- `dependencies[]` — other changes that must happen first
- `owner_role` — who is responsible for implementing this change

### Step 5 — Draft change strategy

Structure the change strategy document with:
1. **Change summary** — what is changing and why
2. **Stakeholder impact** — who is affected, how significantly
3. **Transition plan** — sequence and timeline for changes
4. **Risk register** — what could go wrong during transition
5. **Communication plan** — how and when to inform each stakeholder group
6. **Success criteria** — how to know the change has landed

---

## Output Schema

`future-state.yaml` contains:
- `process_id` — matches PIR `process_id`
- `future_state_version` — "0.1-draft" initially
- `design_date`, `designed_by_role`
- `resolved_gaps[]` — each gap from `gap-analysis.yaml` with its resolution
- `to_be_steps[]` — `id`, `description`, `actor_role_id`, `systems[]`, `confidence`
- `open_assumptions[]` — assumed constraints flagged for user confirmation
- `change_items[]` — each with `change_type`, `effort`, `risk`, `dependencies[]`, `owner_role`

---

## Handoff Instruction

Pass `future-state.yaml` to `process-intake-and-scope` or `process-narrative-authoring` to create the target-state PNS. The future-state steps map directly to `activity_sequence.activities[]` in the new PNS.
