description: Capture and normalise a current-state process description into a structured as-is process YAML with stable step identifiers. Use this skill when the user has a process that is already running and needs to document its current state before gap analysis or redesign; when they provide step lists, SOPs, or process notes that need to be structured; when they say "document what we do today", "capture the current process", or "baseline the process before we change it". Produces a structured as-is process artifact with normalised step IDs.

## Purpose

Capture and normalise the current-state (as-is) process into a structured YAML artifact. The as-is record uses stable `act-NNN` step identifiers that persist across revisions, making gap analysis and change tracking tractable.

---

## When to use this skill

- User describes how a process runs today and wants it documented before redesign
- You need a baseline artifact before running `process-gap-and-exception-analysis`
- PIR exists but steps lack stable IDs — normalise them with `scripts/assign-step-ids.mjs`
- User imports existing process notes, SOPs, or procedure documents for structuring

## When NOT to use this skill

- No PIR exists — run `process-intake-and-scope` first to establish scope and boundaries
- User wants to design a future state only — skip to `future-state-and-change-strategy`
- Do not include aspirational or proposed changes in the as-is record

---

## Capture Workflow

### Step 1 — Import and triage

Identify the source: natural language description, bullet list, existing SOP document, or flowchart image. Determine if a PIR already exists. If not, run `process-intake-and-scope` first.

### Step 2 — Extract and sequence steps

Parse all process steps in the order they occur. Each step must have:
- A single imperative action statement (IEEE 29148)
- An identified actor or role
- Entry criteria (what triggers this step)
- Exit criteria (what signals completion)

### Step 3 — Assign stable IDs

Run `scripts/assign-step-ids.mjs` to assign `act-001`, `act-002`, … identifiers. IDs are:
- Sequential within each process
- Prefixed `act-` for activities, `gw-` for gateways, `evt-` for events
- Stable — once assigned, they do not change even if steps are reordered

### Step 4 — Identify current-state gaps

Flag steps that are:
- Undocumented ("we just know to do it")
- Person-dependent ("only Alice knows this part")
- Inconsistently executed ("sometimes we skip this")
- Missing a named actor

Tag these with `capture_quality: low | medium | high`.

### Step 5 — Record as-is metadata

Document:
- `captured_date` — when this baseline was recorded
- `capture_method` — interview | document-review | observation | workshop
- `process_version` — current version of the process if known (default `"1.0-baseline"`)
- `baseline_status` — `draft | reviewed | approved`

---

## Output Schema

The `as-is-process.yaml` contains:
- `process_id` — matches PIR `process_id`
- `baseline_status` — draft | reviewed | approved
- `captured_date`, `capture_method`, `process_version`
- `steps[]` — each with `id`, `description`, `actor_role_id`, `entry_criteria`, `exit_criteria`, `capture_quality`, `systems[]`, `notes`
- `identified_gaps[]` — steps or sections with low capture quality or person-dependency
- `open_questions[]` — unresolved items from the capture session

---

## Handoff Instruction

Pass `as-is-process.yaml` to `process-gap-and-exception-analysis` to identify deviations, exception paths, and improvement opportunities.

Also pass `pir.yaml` to `process-narrative-authoring` when the as-is record is reviewed and approved.
