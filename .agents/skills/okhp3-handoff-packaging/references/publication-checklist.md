## ISO 9001 §7.5.3 Document Control Requirements

For a publication bundle to satisfy ISO 9001 §7.5.3 (Control of documented information):

1. **Identity** — document ID, version, and date on all artifacts
2. **Format** — YAML for machine-readable; Markdown for human-readable; both for all primary artifacts
3. **Review and approval** — APPROVALS.yaml with at least one Accountable role approval
4. **Availability** — stored in an accessible, retrievable location
5. **Protection** — access controls appropriate to the sensitivity of the content
6. **Distribution** — distribution list in APPROVALS.yaml `distribution[]`
7. **Retention** — schedule defined in document management policy

## MANIFEST.yaml Requirements

The MANIFEST must be the first file in the bundle directory. It must contain:
- SHA256 hash for every artifact
- Empty `missing_required[]` array (no required artifacts absent)
- `quality_band` and `composite_score` from validation report
- `bundle_date` in ISO 8601 format

## APPROVALS.yaml Requirements

Minimum content for a valid APPROVALS.yaml:
- At least one `approvals[]` entry for the process owner role
- All entries have `status: approved` before `effective_date` is set
- `review_date` must be set (recommend 12 months from `effective_date`)
- `distribution[]` must include at least the process owner and all Accountable roles from the RACI
